Accessibility Test
=============
 *  With User testing and UI testing complete we still felt that these test wern't thourogh enough. THey didn't account for <br />
    the 5% of the population that are colour blind.
 
 * We did some research and found that when red and green used in the same display, it can be extremely harsh on people with color blindess.<br/>
   We soon realised that we had to modify our stats taking page, as red and green are the two prominent colours. This would make for<br>
   difficult / unappealing viewing for people with Protanopia or deuteranopia (green and/or red color blindness). We used a website (toptal) to </br>
   simulate the color blind colours on our app's activity.</br>

* Although we had symbols to indicate the subtract score, we still felt these colors could come accross unappealing or even confusing<br>
  for someone sufferring from colour blindness. To solve this problem, we changed the colour red, to a light grey.<br>

</br>

*  The results on Toptal, proved that the changes made were a lot more friendly to those suffering with colour blindness.
