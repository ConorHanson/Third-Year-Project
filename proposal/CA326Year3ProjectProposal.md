**Project Description:**

We will be creating an Android application that will allow grassroot rugby teams, such as schools, youths, and lower level adult teams to collect and review game statistics in a quick and easy way on their mobile or tablet devices. The app will be designed in a way that it is simple enough for anyone to use, from a dedicated team manager, to a parent volunteer, to a sub. Currently many clubs can’t afford the applications out there that carry out this task as they are aimed at elite teams. This means clubs have to collect data manually, which limits what data you can collect, or in some case not collect the data at all. Overall, this hinders coaches when it comes to knowing how games went, as they purely have to rely on their own recall.

Upon starting up the application, the user will be able to create a new club and give it a name and password, or login to an existing club. Within the club each user will be able to create a team or select an existing team. This will allow people to work with multiple teams in the same school or club, be it regularly or just as a one off, whilst having easy access to each team. From the team screen, users can create matches, edit and review previous matches, and view and edit their squad. 

To collect stats in the match, the user will be able to set up a game by giving the match a unique name, entering the team (using assigned player numbers to avoid GDPR issues), and hitting start. This will bring the user to a screen where they will be shown a pitch with a grid and a match clock. The user will be able to stop and start the match clock as they wish. This will also be able to inform the app when the game reaches half time and full time. To record a stat, the user will select on the grid where the incident occured, this will not not only record its position but also when it happened. The screen will then change to allow them to select what has occured and depending on the stat they select, they may be able to select which player did it.

After a match has been completed and saved, a coach will be able to access a match report and view team and player statistics of the ganme, as well as any other matches they have taken statistics for.




**Division of work:**

For the division of work we decided that it was vital that we both did an equal amount of work. There is going to be a lot of work involved in this project and it won’t come out as well as we hope, if one person is left to do most of the work.

After some deliberation, we decided that we would split the work on a feature by feature basis for the most part, with Conor mostly focusing on front end, and Andrew mostly working with the back end side of things. We decided this, as these were the areas that each of us were most familiar with from previous experience. We came to the conclusion that it was best if this was not a hardline division of work, and that we would both do some work on each other's end to avoid tunnel vision. This will also allow for constructive criticism which is vital in projects like this.
