After creating an account or signing into an existing account the user is brought to the app home page. Here users will have the option to create a new team, view the stats of a match or start a new match and take statistics for it. Users will also be able to log out of their account from this page.

Before taking any stats, the user will have to create a team. To do this the user selects &quot;Create team&quot; on the home page. Where they will be brought to a page where they&#39;ll be asked to enter a name for the team, the teams&#39; coach and the teams age group.
